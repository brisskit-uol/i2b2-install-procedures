# Inspect the POM.

There is a production profile and a development profile.
The build is production by default.
Look at the enironment.type property setting, 
which is used to produce two artifacts (development and production versions)... 

To build a production artifact, the default install invocation is sufficient...
mvn clean install

To build a development artifact...
mvn clean install -Denvironment.type=development

The development version has facilities for dropping all sql artifacts. 
Hence you must explicitly request a development build.

NOTES:
======
(1) For development testing, the lib directory needs to be populated.
    Do a maven install and then unzip the artifact's lib directory.
(2) The stopping and starting of JBoss needs looking at.
(3) Linux accounts and permissions could do with a review.
(4) The integration user (See the install admin procedures' script)
    needs more thought.
(5) The SqlServer and Oracle details have been removed, 
    for the moment and for the sake of clarity.
    Concentration has shifted to the open source database Postgresql.
    If we need SqlServer or Oracle, their details would need to be included:
    not difficult to do, but may be a pain to test.
