#  Command line tools for installing an i2b2 domain and one demo project.       #
#===============================================================================#

QUICK START.
============

1. Unzip this package into a convenient place on a server intending to host an i2b2 domain.
   By convention this should be /var/local/brisskit/i2b2
2. Copy the file {procedures}/bin/global/set.sh into the above directory
3. Edit the set.sh file, ensuring that the I2B2_INSTALL_DIRECTORY variable points to the above.
   Also ensure the paths to the i2b2 install procedures and the i2b2 admin procedures are correct.
   (The admin procedures themselves are installed by the current install procedures).
4  Review configuration settings within the config directory.
   NB: (a) Install-time-only config settings are contained in the defaults.sh file.
       Execution-time settings are held in the other files and directories 
       below the config directory.
       (b) You need to create an 'integration' OS user account beforehand.
5. The order of completion is by number within the procedures/bin/installs directory
   or use the {procedures}/bin/compositions/install-all.sh to install everything in one go.
6. NB. You (or your script) needs to source the set.sh file before executing any of the install
   scripts contained here. 
   
   Be aware, some commands (eg: to set up the webclient in directory /var/www ) 
   are prefixed with 'sudo', so you will be prompted for a password.
   
   Alternatively, you can execute the overall install using sudo.  
   But remember that environment variables will be lost if you (or your script) does
   not use the -E option on sudo. For example:
   
   source ./set.sh
   sudo -E ./procedures/bin/compositions/install-all.sh job-20130208
   
   (Of course, it is not good practice to run things as root.)
